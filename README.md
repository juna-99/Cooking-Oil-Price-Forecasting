# 🛢️Cooking Oil Price Forecasting using SARIMA and LSTM in Malaysia 


## 📈Project Overview 

This project focuses on forecasting cooking oil prices across all 14 states in Malaysia using two predictive models: **Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA)** and **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks**. The study aims to provide accurate price forecasts to aid stakeholders such as policymakers, businesses, and consumers in making informed decisions. 

## 🔥Motivation 

Cooking oil prices in Malaysia exhibit significant fluctuations due to factors like global commodity market shifts, supply chain disruptions, and domestic economic policies. This project seeks to build a robust price prediction model leveraging historical price data to analyze seasonal trends and long-term dependencies. 

## 🗂️Data Source 

- **Dataset:** Historical cooking oil price data (2022-2023)
- **Source:** Malaysia Open Data Portal (data.gov.my)
- **Preprocessing:** Data cleaning, aggregation by state, handling missing values, and log transformation

## 🔄Project Workflow 
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data from Malaysia Open Data Portal.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform data, ensuring consistency and handling missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identify trends, seasonal patterns, and key insights.
4. **Model Development**: Implement SARIMA and LSTM models to forecast price trends.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Compare model performance using error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE).
6. **Visualization & Interpretation**: Use Power BI to present results and insights.
7. **Deployment & Future Enhancements**: Explore improvements, including real-time updates.

## 📊Results & Analysis 

### Model Performance
- **SARIMA Model**: Demonstrated superior performance in capturing seasonal trends with lower error rates.
- **LSTM Model**: Showed potential in handling complex patterns but exhibited higher variability.

### Error Metrics
| State        | SARIMA MAE | SARIMA RMSE | SARIMA MAPE | LSTM MAE | LSTM RMSE | LSTM MAPE |
|-------------|------------|-------------|-------------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Johor       | 0.020      | 0.023       | 0.295%      | 0.320    | 0.365     | 3.710%    |
| Kedah       | 0.009      | 0.010       | 0.136%      | 0.244    | 0.287     | 2.946%    |
| Selangor    | 0.012      | 0.012       | 0.173%      | 0.273    | 0.319     | 3.236%    |

### Observations
- **SARIMA** consistently provided more stable and accurate predictions for states with strong seasonal patterns.
- **LSTM**, while capable of capturing complex relationships, had higher variability and was more sensitive to data fluctuations.
- **Final Recommendation**: SARIMA was more reliable for this dataset, but LSTM can be improved with further tuning and larger datasets.
